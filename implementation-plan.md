Implementation Plan: Virtual Museum (Base Version)
Phase 1: Setup
Step 1: Set up the development environment  
Install Node.js and npm on your machine.  

Create a new project directory and initialize a Node.js project using the command line.  

Install essential dependencies:  
React for the frontend UI.  

Three.js for 3D rendering.  

Express for the backend server.  

MongoDB driver for database interactions.

Set up version control with Git and create a repository on GitHub.

Test:  
Run a simple "Hello World" Node.js script to verify the environment is correctly set up.  

Check the project directory to ensure all dependencies are installed in a node_modules folder.

Step 2: Configure the frontend with React and Three.js  
Set up a new React project using a tool like Create React App.  

Add Three.js as a dependency to the React project.  

Create a basic React component that sets up a Three.js scene and renders a simple 3D object, like a cube.

Test:  
Launch the React app in a browser and confirm that the 3D cube is visible and rotates smoothly.

Step 3: Set up the backend with Node.js and Express  
Create a separate directory for the backend.  

Initialize a new Node.js project in this directory and install Express.  

Set up a basic Express server with one route (e.g., /api/test) that returns a simple JSON message like {"message": "Server is running"}.  

Connect to a MongoDB instance (either local or cloud-based) and define a basic schema for artworks with fields like title, artist, and theme.

Test:  
Start the Express server and use a tool like Postman to send a GET request to /api/test. Verify that it returns the expected JSON message.  

Add a sample artwork to MongoDB and retrieve it using a database query tool.

Step 4: Configure hosting platforms  
Sign up for a Vercel account and connect it to the frontend GitHub repository.  

Sign up for a Heroku account and create a new app for the backend.  

Add environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection string) to both Vercel and Heroku for secure configuration.

Test:  
Deploy a simple static page to Vercel and a basic "Hello World" API to Heroku.  

Open the deployed URLs in a browser to confirm both are accessible and working.

Phase 2: Frontend Development
Step 5: Create the central hub  
In the React app, create a new component called CentralHub.  

Use Three.js to build a circular room with a basic floor texture (e.g., a placeholder mosaic).  

Add three archways as simple 3D shapes (e.g., rectangles or planes) to represent entrances to the themed rooms.

Test:  
Load the central hub in the browser and ensure the room renders with the three archways visible in their correct positions.

Step 6: Develop the Sunflower Room  
Create a new React component called SunflowerRoom.  

Set up the room with:  
Walls in a golden-yellow color with a subtle texture (e.g., canvas-like).  

A warm-toned floor (e.g., wood or soil).

Add basic lighting to mimic natural sunlight using a directional light source.  

Place simple placeholders (e.g., flat planes) where artworks will eventually go.

Test:  
Switch to the Sunflower Room from the central hub and confirm the golden ambiance and sunlight-like lighting are present.

Step 7: Develop the Olive Trees Room  
Create a new React component called OliveTreesRoom.  

Set up the room with:  
Walls in a green shade with a leaf or bark-like texture.  

A stone or mossy floor texture.

Add dappled lighting to mimic sunlight filtering through leaves (e.g., using multiple point lights).  

Include placeholders for artworks.

Test:  
Switch to the Olive Trees Room and verify the green ambiance and dappled lighting distinguish it from other rooms.

Step 8: Develop the Wheat Fields Room  
Create a new React component called WheatFieldsRoom.  

Set up the room with:  
Walls in earthy tones with a wheat stalk or rustic texture.  

A wooden or dirt-like floor.

Add soft, golden-hour lighting using warm ambient light.  

Include placeholders for artworks.

Test:  
Switch to the Wheat Fields Room and confirm the rustic, earthy feel and golden lighting are consistent with the theme.

Step 9: Implement basic navigation between rooms  
Add simple navigation controls, such as clickable archways or buttons, to move between the central hub and the three themed rooms.  

Ensure each room component loads when its corresponding archway or button is selected.

Test:  
Click each archway or button to navigate between rooms and verify that the correct room appears without errors.

Phase 3: Backend Development
Step 10: Design the database schema  
In MongoDB, create a collection named artworks.  

Define a schema with these fields:  
title (string)  

artist (string)  

description (string)  

theme (string: "sunflowers", "olive-trees", "wheat-fields")  

imageUrl (string)

Add at least one sample artwork for each theme manually or via a script.

Test:  
Use a MongoDB tool (e.g., Compass) to check that the sample artworks are stored and can be queried by theme.

Step 11: Implement API endpoints for artworks  
In the Express backend, create a GET endpoint at /api/artworks/:theme (e.g., /api/artworks/sunflowers).  

Set up the endpoint to query MongoDB and return all artworks matching the specified theme in JSON format.

Test:  
Use Postman to send a GET request to /api/artworks/sunflowers and verify it returns the correct sample artwork data.

Phase 4: Integration
Step 12: Connect the frontend to the backend  
In the React app, add logic to each room component to fetch artwork data from the /api/artworks/:theme endpoint using a library like Axios or the browser's fetch API.  

Display the artwork titles and descriptions next to their placeholders in each room.

Test:  
Load each room in the browser and confirm that the correct artwork titles and descriptions appear based on the room's theme.

Step 13: Add basic interactive elements  
Make each artwork placeholder clickable in the 3D scene.  

When clicked, show a simple pop-up or text overlay with the artwork's title and description.

Test:  
Click an artwork in any room and verify that the pop-up displays the correct title and description.

Step 14: Implement basic environmental sounds  
Use the Web Audio API to add a subtle sound to each room:  
Sunflower Room: birds chirping.  

Olive Trees Room: rustling leaves.  

Wheat Fields Room: gentle wind.

Ensure the sound starts when entering a room and stops when leaving.

Test:  
Navigate to each room and confirm the appropriate sound plays and stops as expected.

Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
Step 15: Optimize 3D assets for performance  
Use compressed image formats (e.g., JPEG or PNG) for room textures to reduce file size.  

Apply basic Level of Detail (LOD) techniques to any complex 3D models, if present.  

Check that the scene renders efficiently without noticeable lag.

Test:  
Use browser developer tools to monitor frame rate. Ensure it stays above 30 FPS on a standard device.

Step 16: Conduct basic user testing  
Simulate user interactions or invite a small group to explore the museum.  

Test navigation between rooms, artwork interactions, and overall performance.

Test:  
Confirm users can move between rooms and interact with artworks without issues. Note any feedback for refinement.

Step 17: Prepare for deployment  
Organize the frontend and backend code into modular folders (e.g., /components, /scenes, /routes).  

Set up deployment configurations for Vercel (frontend) and Heroku (backend).  

Write a README file with instructions for running the project locally and deploying it.

Test:  
Deploy the museum to Vercel and Heroku. Visit the live URL to ensure all rooms, artworks, and interactions work as expected.
