# Project Architecture

## Project Structure
```
virtual-museum/
├── package.json     # Project configuration and dependencies
└── test.js         # Environment setup verification script
```

## File Purposes

### package.json
- Defines project metadata and dependencies
- Configures npm scripts for running and testing
- Manages version requirements for all dependencies
- Current dependencies include:
  - Frontend: React, React DOM, Three.js, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei
  - Backend: Express, Mongoose

### test.js
- Verifies the development environment setup
- Checks for proper installation of dependencies
- Confirms Node.js is working correctly
- Validates package versions

## Planned Architecture

### Frontend (To be implemented)
- React components for UI
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- @react-three/fiber for React and Three.js integration
- @react-three/drei for additional Three.js helpers

### Backend (To be implemented)
- Express.js server
- MongoDB database with Mongoose ODM
- RESTful API endpoints
- Static file serving
