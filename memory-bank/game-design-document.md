Museum Layout
Central Hub:
The entry point of the museum, this space introduces visitors to the three themes. It features a neutral yet thematic design with a floor mosaic blending depictions of sunflowers, olive branches, and wheat stalks. The walls display a subtle gradient transitioning from golden sunflower hues to green olive tones and earthy wheat shades, visually connecting the rooms. Three archways—golden, green, and earthy—lead to the themed rooms.

Themed Rooms:
Three distinct rooms branch off from the central hub:
Sunflower Room

Olive Trees Room

Wheat Fields Room

Transitions:
Seamless movement between rooms is achieved through open archways or passages where colors, textures, and ambiance gradually shift. For example, as visitors approach the sunflower room, the walls warm to golden hues, and the flooring hints at soil or petals, ensuring a natural flow.
